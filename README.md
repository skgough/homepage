# homepage
My browser homepage that I use on a daily basis.

[Live here](https://skgough.github.io/homepage/)

Basically a bookmark list with some extra functionality. Using [Query Strings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure) I can search lots of websites from my homepage which I think is neat.. Most websites implement their search using query strings, so this feature is really powerful for things like searching price history of Amazon listings on CamelCamelCamel.

Another cool feature are the searchable accordion lists that I'm using for subreddits. You can search by subreddit name or URL. If the search is drilled down to only one result and you hit Enter, it will navigate to that page. A really quick way to get to a specific subpage of a website that I enjoy using.
